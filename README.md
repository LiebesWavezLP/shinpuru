## Intro

シンプル (shinpuru), a simple *(as th name says)*, multi purpose Discord Bot written in Go, using bwmarrin's package [discord.go](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) as API and gateway wrapper. The focus on this bot is not to punch in as much features and commands as possible, just some commands and features I thought wich would be useful and which were the mostly used from my older Discord bots, like the [zekroBot 2](https://github.com/zekroTJA/zekroBot2), and more on making this bot as reliable and stable as possible.

Also, I want to use this project as chance for me, to get some deeper into Go and larger Go project structures. In a later development state, this bol will detach zekroBot 2.

# Development state

This project is in a verry early development state, so, currently, the bot is not available as 24/7 version. If you want to use this bot by yourself, pull the code by cloning the repository or download the assets as zip [here](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/archive/master.zip).

Then, get all dependencies and build the binary. After that, generate a config by starting the bot, fill in your data and go on ;)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru.git
$ bash ./installdeps.sh
$ go build -o shinpuru ./src/
$ ./shinpuru -c yourconfig.yaml
```

And yes, as you may notice, this bot currently depends on a MySql database. Actually, I want to make this bot also compatible with SqLite or MongoDB, but this will take a while until this is most priority. ^^
