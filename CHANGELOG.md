1.20.0

## Changes

### Using Reactions to control `clear` command [#249]

You can now either select single messages to be deleted by adding the ‚ùå reaction to the messages or you can delete all messages after (and including) the message marked with the üîª reaction. The delete action is then performed on entering the [`clear selected`](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/Commands#clear) command.

### Setting multiple autoroles [#147]

You can now set multiple autoroles in the web interface as well as via the [`autorole`](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/Commands#autorole) command.

### Invite Badge

As you might know, when the web interface is enabled, you can use `<address>/invite` as redirect link to the invite link of the bot instance (see https://shnp.de/invite, for example). Additional to that, an endpoint was added which generates a badge with the current guild count of the instance.

Examples:

- ![](https://shnp.de/invite/badge.svg) `https://shnp.de/invite/badge.svg`
- ![](https://c.shnp.de/invite/badge.svg?title=invite%20(canary)&color=orange) `https://c.shnp.de/invite/badge.svg?title=invite%20(canary)&color=orange`

## Bugfixes

- shireikan now also uses dgrs state when passed.
- Hydrated guild states are now obtained where required.
- The tagxinput component has now proper item alignment.
- Setting `@everyone` as autorole is no more possible.
