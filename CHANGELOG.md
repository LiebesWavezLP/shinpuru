<!-- ## Bug Fixes

-  -->

## Backstage

- Update API of package [multierror](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/pkg/multierror).
- Refactored all around the report packages to now use a proper type "enum" and for a bit more logical package structure.  
<sub>(Tho, the general package structure of shinpuru is still horrible and really really really needs a complete refactor process...)</sub>
- Frontend updated to Angular 11.
