## Major Changes

### Ban/Mute Timeout [#246]

You can now specify a timeout duration or date to mute and ban reports. After this time, the victim is automatically unbanned or unmuted, but the report will not be removed.

Here you can read on how to use timeouts in the mute and ban command.
- [`mute`](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/Commands#mute)
- [`ban`](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/Commands#ban)

The expiration of reports is defaultly checked every 5 minutes, but you can specify an other schedule in the config.
```yml
schedules:
  reportsexpiration: "@every 5m"
```

### SQLite3 Deprecation

The SQLite3 driver was marked as deprecated in patch [1.16.0](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/releases/tag/1.16.0) and has now fully been removed. If you need information why this step was taken and how to switch to MariaDB for development, please read [this document](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/SQLIte-Deprecation).

- [dgrs](https://github.com/zekroTJA/dgrs) was now updated to v0.3.0 which allows dehydration of removed objects and caching of Userâ†’GuildIDs relationships.

- Hence, the load time of the guild list in the web interface should be significantly faster. [#257]

- Messages are now only cached for 14 Days in state.
