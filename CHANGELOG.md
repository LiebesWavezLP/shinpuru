# `userinfo` user command [#308]

The `/user` slash command can now be directly executed on members using the `userinfo` user command. This is available when right-clicking on a user, going to `Apps` and clicking `userinfo`. Then, the user info card will be dropped into your currently selected text channel.

# `quotemessage` message command

The `/quote` slash command is now also usable directly via the `quotemessage` app command when right-clicking the message to be quoted. The quote message will appear in the currently selected channel as well.

# Mute rework [#315]

Because Discord recently added the `timeout` feature, the usage of specific mute roles which disallow sending messages in all channels is no more necessary. Instead, the mute/unmute command and web interface hook utilizes the timeout implementation of Discord. So, you do not need to setup and maintain a muterole anymore and you can directly use the timeout integration of Discord with the advantages of shinpurus modlog! ðŸ¤¯
