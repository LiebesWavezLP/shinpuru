# [`mocks`](mocks/)

This directory contains automatically generated mocks for service interfaces used to unit test services.

Feel free to take a look at the `*_test.go` files in the services to see these mocks in action. For example, you can take a look into the [test cases of the report service](../internal/services/report/report_test.go).
